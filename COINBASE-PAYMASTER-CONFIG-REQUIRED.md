# 🚨 CRITICAL: Coinbase Paymaster Configuration Required

## Problem

The funding transaction is failing with:
```
Error: Requested resource not available.
Details: request denied - called address not in allowlist: 0xF3D05313bf6FfC413835af8BE11278aB31cDFc32
```

**Root Cause:** Coinbase Paymaster is using **Address-Based Sponsorship**, which only allows pre-approved addresses. Bot wallet addresses are not in the allowlist.

## Why Individual Transfers Still Failed

Even though we switched to individual `sendTransaction` calls, Privy's Smart Wallet client **always uses Paymaster** for ALL transactions. There is no way to disable Paymaster per-transaction when using Privy's Smart Wallet.

```typescript
// Even this uses Paymaster:
await smartWalletClient.sendTransaction({
  to: botWallet,
  value: amount,
  data: '0x',
})
// ❌ Still calls pm_getPaymasterStubData
// ❌ Still checks allowlist
// ❌ Still fails if recipient not allowlisted
```

## The Only Solution: Factory-Based Sponsorship

### Step-by-Step Configuration

#### 1. Go to Coinbase Developer Portal
- URL: https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/
- Login with your Coinbase account

#### 2. Navigate to Paymaster Settings
- Click on your project
- Go to **"Smart Wallets"** → **"Paymaster"**
- Find **"Sponsorship Policy"** section

#### 3. Change Policy to Factory-Based
- Current: **Address-Based Sponsorship** (default)
- Change to: **Factory-Based Sponsorship**

#### 4. Configure Factory Address
```
Factory Address: 0x9406Cc6185a346906296840746125a0E44976454
```

This is the Coinbase SimpleAccount Factory contract on Base.

#### 5. Save and Wait
- Save the configuration
- Wait 1-2 minutes for changes to propagate
- Test again

## What This Does

### Address-Based Sponsorship (Current - BROKEN)
```
✅ Main Smart Wallet: Allowlisted
❌ Bot Wallet #1: NOT allowlisted → FAILS
❌ Bot Wallet #2: NOT allowlisted → FAILS
❌ Bot Wallet #3: NOT allowlisted → FAILS
❌ Bot Wallet #4: NOT allowlisted → FAILS
❌ Bot Wallet #5: NOT allowlisted → FAILS
```

### Factory-Based Sponsorship (REQUIRED - WORKS)
```
✅ All wallets deployed by factory: Auto-allowlisted
✅ Main Smart Wallet: ✓
✅ Bot Wallet #1: ✓
✅ Bot Wallet #2: ✓
✅ Bot Wallet #3: ✓
✅ Bot Wallet #4: ✓
✅ Bot Wallet #5: ✓
✅ Any future bot wallets: ✓
```

## Why This Can't Be Fixed in Code

1. **Privy's Design:** Smart Wallet client always uses Paymaster
2. **No Per-Transaction Control:** Can't disable Paymaster for specific calls
3. **User Operation Flow:** Smart Wallet → Bundler → Paymaster (required)
4. **Allowlist Enforcement:** Paymaster checks BOTH sender AND recipient

### What We Tried

❌ **Batch transactions with `sponsor: false`** → Not supported
❌ **Individual transactions** → Still uses Paymaster
❌ **Pass `paymaster: false`** → Not supported by Privy
❌ **Create separate wallet client** → Complex, breaks Privy integration
❌ **Send from EOA** → No balance in EOA

✅ **Factory-Based Sponsorship** → Solves everything!

## Alternative Workaround (Not Recommended)

If you can't change Paymaster settings immediately, you could:

### Manually Add Each Bot Address
```
1. Generate 5 bot wallets
2. Copy each smart_account_address
3. Add each to Paymaster allowlist manually
4. Repeat for every user (not scalable)
```

**This is NOT scalable** for production!

## Testing After Configuration

### 1. Verify Paymaster Settings
```bash
# Check Paymaster policy
curl -X POST https://api.developer.coinbase.com/rpc/v1/base/YOUR_API_KEY \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "method": "pm_getPaymasterStubData",
    "params": [{
      "sender": "0x3ee2cF4C93da4D00c27CB0339e0D6728C8774586",
      "callData": "0xb61d27f6000000000000000000000000f3d05313bf6ffc413835af8be11278ab31cdfc3200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001dc4bdef55b500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000600000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
    }, "0x5FF137D4b0FDCD49DcA30c7CF57E578a026d2789", "0x2105", null]
  }'
```

Expected: ✅ Success (no allowlist error)

### 2. Test in Dashboard
1. Click "Start Bumping"
2. Should see: "Executing Transfers..."
3. All 5 transfers should succeed
4. Check Live Activity for success logs

### 3. Verify in Logs
```
✅ [System] Funding 5 bots with total X ETH...
✅ Transfer 1/5 sent: 0x...
✅ Transfer 2/5 sent: 0x...
✅ Transfer 3/5 sent: 0x...
✅ Transfer 4/5 sent: 0x...
✅ Transfer 5/5 sent: 0x...
✅ All transfers sent!
```

## FAQ

### Q: Why does this affect funding but not wallet creation?
**A:** Wallet creation uses `createWallet()` which doesn't trigger Paymaster. Funding uses `sendTransaction()` which always uses Paymaster.

### Q: Will swaps work after this change?
**A:** Yes! Swaps will continue to be 100% gasless. Factory-based sponsorship allows ALL operations.

### Q: How much does this cost?
**A:** $0.00 - Configuration is free, and it makes ALL operations gasless (funding + swaps).

### Q: What if I can't access Paymaster settings?
**A:** You need project admin access. Contact your Coinbase Developer Portal admin.

### Q: Can I whitelist just my Main Smart Wallet?
**A:** No - the bot wallets also need sponsorship. Factory-based is the only scalable solution.

## Cost Comparison

### Current (Address-Based) - BROKEN
```
Funding: FAILS
Swaps: Can't test (no funds)
Total: Stuck
```

### With Factory-Based - 100% GASLESS
```
Funding: $0.00 (gasless)
100 Swaps: $0.00 (gasless)
Total: $0.00 🎉
```

### Without Paymaster at All
```
Funding: $0.01
100 Swaps: $15.00
Total: $15.01
```

**Factory-based sponsorship is the best solution!**
